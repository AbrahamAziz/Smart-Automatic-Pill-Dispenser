# Smart-Automatic-Pill-Dispenser
  As the aging population in Canada continues to increase rapidly, the consumptions of prescribed medicine are on the rise. Approximately 50% of patients with multiple medications for their chronic illnesses do not take their medications as on time. This poor medication adherence leads to increased morbidity rate and health care cost.
Method & Key Findings: 
This project presents a smart automatic pill dispenser that automatically dispenses medications at a pre-set time. This project was fully built from scratch, with the case and internal components 3D printed, for the brains of the device we have used a raspberry pi B+ which was programmed to accordingly to the device. 
Current pill dispensers in the market require patients to arrange their pills themselves. This can lead to errors and possible health risks. To mitigate these errors, we have created a disk that only fits for certain types of pills. By doing so, if the caretaker accidentally places the wrong pill in the dispenser, nothing will come out. Also, since our Smart Automatic Pill Dispenser is very user friendly, it will allow anyone to assist the senior while minimizing any human error.
